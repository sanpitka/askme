# AskMe

The original version of AskMe study application was developed by my father and his coworkers in Niva-Kaija school back in 90s. This mobile app is a stripped-down version of the original app, suitable for learning vocabularies, arithmetics, or anything that can be shaped into writable questions and short answers.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions in [Flutter Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/quick) to try out the application either on browser or your mobile device.
